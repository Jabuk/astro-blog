Alright, let's talk what *"Żerca"* actually means. It's pretty funny, because even though it's a Polish word, most Polish people have no idea what it means.

First connotation is with the word *"pożerać"*, which means *"devour"*, so logical conclusion is that *"żerca"* is the *"devourer"*. This, however, is not actually correct! In old Polish, this word appears to be a translation of latin *"architriclinus"* and means *"master of ceremony"* (in the context of a wedding), *"matchmaker"*, *"marriage broker"*. Basically, he's the wedding official that played crucial role in old slavic society - he matched couples together, and then officiated the marriage ceremony.

In praslavic languages, word *"žьrьcь"* meant *"the one who sacrifices"* or *"the one who makes the offering"*. Basically, he was the priest or a shaman that would lead religious activities. This is actually how Franciszek M. Piątkowski interprets this word in his "Powiernik" series that is a basis for the *"Żerca"* game.

Finally, English Wikipedia translates *"żerca"* as *"zhrets"*. This doesn't roll off tongue easily, so we're thinking about naming the English version of the game **"Zhrets: The Sacrificer"**, or **"Zhrets: The Matchmaker"**. Which of this one do you think sounds better?
