Today is the Independence Day in Poland. And here I am, learning basics of Astro. Why is that? I started building a website for Slovian Game Studios, that I work with to create a video game "Żerca". I started building one using _Opencode_, but even though AI got crazy powerful and can get you far, you need to have foundational skills for what you do. Sometimes simple changes are frustrating to get right with AI - you can achieve the result you want by changing a line or two, as long as you know what you're doing. On the other side, it can produce in one evening amount of work it would take you weeks, if not months!

And so I'm working on my own independence - from the job I have, from AI, and for independence in expressing myself on the web. 

That's it for this post. The main goal today is to learn Astro, not to write blog, but why not use this opportunity to write some of my thoughts?
